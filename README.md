# Quantum-Portfolio-Optimization

#Most of my work in Quantum Computing research and development has been proprietary for Academia (UB) or Infosys (Quantum Centre of Excellence). So I have created this Portfolio Optimization use case to display my work using Qiskit Framework and Jupyter Notebook environment. This version is true till Qiskit 4.0.1 and was made in 2020. Feel free to pull for updating and credits.
